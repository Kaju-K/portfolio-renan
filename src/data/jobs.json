He also wanted a BRB (Be Right Back) screen as well, consisting of him ocasionally looking at his viewers to see if they are still there.<br /><br /><b>ROLE</b><br />I created the entire project: art direction, character design, character animation, background illustration and compositing.<br /><br /><b>METHODS</b><br />I used the software Blender (Grease Pencil) to make 2D sketches of character design and animation. After the rough pass was done, I created a custom rig inside Toon Boom and from there I made the final animation with all its subtleties. Meanwhile I vector illustrated the background in Adobe Illustration. Finally it was all composited inside After effects.
